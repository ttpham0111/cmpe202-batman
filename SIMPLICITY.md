## Personal Project Log For Agile Modeling Values: Simplicity

### Week #1
* While discussing the game idea, we tried to demonstrate each level of an idea by drawing diagrams. Diagrams help us visualize things which simplifies the development.
* For the efficient development of the game, each team members were assigned one or two technologies to research on. After this investigation focusing on pros and cons of technologies, we can decide the most suitable technology for the selected game idea which can ease the development.

### Week #2
* After selecting the game idea, while defining the scope for it, we collectively agreed to keep the scope as simple as it can be at first level. We have kept a final optimistic goal for this game, but we decided to move step by step towards our final goal starting from the simplest instead of directly jumping into the final goal.
* Instead of directly jumping into the development, we first started defining the architecture, designing the system, researching on the story and characters of the game. This will help us in efficient development process and avoid complexities in future.

### Week #3
* To follow the simplicity, all the team members decided to first learn phaserJS, then start the implementation.
* The team members divided the basic tasks among themselves. These tasks include defining the architecture, researching on the characters, designing UI wireframe, etc. These simple and basic tasks are very important in the game development process as it will give us clear view of the game.

### Week #4
* We collectively divided implementing different modules of the projects. We tried to keep each modules as simple as it can be. Later, we will combine all the modules. This will help us in the faster development.
* We started development from the basic simple use cases. This step by step process will help us in implementing less buggy code.

### Week #5
* We defined broader backlog items and divided them into simple subtasks. This will improve the development speed.
* Each team member came up with their completed subtasks and we merged those tasks to compelete a broader backlog item by sitting together.
